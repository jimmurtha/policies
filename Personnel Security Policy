Personnel Security Policy
=========================
Effective Date:  June 4, 2019

1.0        Purpose
------------------

In order to create a safe and secure workplace and to ensure that
Archway Health employees are qualified to perform the jobs for which the
organization hires them, the organization will conduct pre-employment
screening, including criminal background checks, drug screening, credit
worthiness and educational checks on all potential new personnel prior
to starting employment.

It is important that the organization’s missions are supported by
qualified employees, in a safe and secure environment for all personnel,
including visitors, clients, and employees.  It is also important that
the organization take meaningful actions to protect its employees,
customers, funds, property, and other assets.

This policy is intended to support the verification of credentials,
criminal history, and other information related to employment decisions
that assist the organization in meeting its commitments.

2.0        Definitions
----------------------

Definitions are located in the Information Security Program Definitions
document.  

If you do not find a definition for an unfamiliar term referenced within
this document, please contact the Chief Security Officer or her/his
designate for clarification.

3.0        Scope
----------------

This Policy applies to all potential new employees (whether full-time,
part-time, seasonal, or temporary), affiliates, subsidiaries,
Subcontractors, Service Providers, and any individual or entity that has
access to Information Resources.

Compliance is mandatory.

Personnel who have questions regarding this Policy should consult with
the Chief Security Officer or her/his designate.

4.0        Risk Statement
-------------------------

This Policy is necessary for the consistent processing of new personnel
in order to ensure the new personnel’s fitness for employment.

Without this Policy, the steps required to ensure the fitness for
employment may be applied incorrectly and/or indiscriminately per
individual.

In addition, during the onboarding process, many data elements collected
regarding the potential employee fall under regulatory guidance.  The
steps outlined further in this policy are stated in order to ensure the
steps are performed as necessary with the utmost regard for the
potential new employee’s privacy.

5.0        Requirements
-----------------------

an I-9 form. [[4]](#cmnt-ref4)

Because the pre-employment forms facilitate the collection of personal
information, including credit information, information about education,
certifications, prior employment, background check information and the
testing for drug usage, notice of the collection of the above
information (not an exhaustive list) must be given to the potential new
personnel and the individual must provide a signed acknowledgement and
authorization prior to the collection of the information.

Human Resources shall perform, or contract for the performance of a
comprehensive background check to include the potential new employees’
assertions of previous employment, education, and credentials
earned. [[5]](#cmnt-ref5)

In addition, the background check must include a credit check, criminal
background check, drug, and reference checks and shall be proportional
to the business requirements, the classification of the information to
be accessed, and the perceived risks. [[6]](#cmnt-ref6)

All offers of employment will be contingent on the satisfactory results
of a background investigation and drug screening.

Upon satisfactory completion of the background checks, 
Human Resources will notify the hiring manager of the start date.

The hiring manager will notify IT Support of the start date and the
appropriate role for the individual that encompasses the appropriate
access and privileges the potential new-employee will require to perform
their job.

In addition, the hiring manager must secure any other items such as VPN
access, credit cards, and mobile device(s) as required.

All new personnel must sign the terms and conditions of the employment
contract, which shall include their responsibilities for information
security and include confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements prior
