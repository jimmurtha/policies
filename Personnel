Personnel Security Policy
    
Effective Date:  June 4, 2019

1.0        Purpose

In order to create a safe and secure workplace and to ensure that Archway Health employees are qualified to perform the jobs for which the organization hires them, the organization will conduct pre-employment screening, including criminal background checks, drug screening, credit worthiness and educational checks on all potential new personnel prior to starting employment.

It is important that the organization’s missions are supported by qualified employees, in a safe and secure environment for all personnel, including visitors, clients, and employees.  It is also important that the organization take meaningful actions to protect its employees, customers, funds, property, and other assets.

This policy is intended to support the verification of credentials, criminal history, and other information related to employment decisions that assist the organization in meeting its commitments.

2.0        Definitions

3.0        Scope

This Policy applies to all potential new employees (whether full-time, part-time, seasonal, or temporary), affiliates, subsidiaries, Subcontractors, Service Providers, and any individual or entity that has access to Information Resources.

Compliance is mandatory.

Personnel who have questions regarding this Policy should consult with the Chief Security Officer or her/his designate.

1. Risk Statement

This Policy is necessary for the consistent processing of new personnel in order to ensure the new personnel’s fitness for employment. 

Without this Policy, the steps required to ensure the fitness for employment may be applied incorrectly and/or indiscriminately per individual.

In addition, during the onboarding process, many data elements collected regarding the potential employee fall under regulatory guidance.  The steps outlined further in this policy are stated in order to ensure the steps are performed as necessary with the utmost regard for the potential new employee’s privacy.

1. Requirements

Attracts, Develops, and Retains Individual Archway Health provides the mentoring and training needed to attract, develop, and retain sufficient and competent personnel and outsourced service providers to support the achievement of objectives.[a]

Define and clearly communicate to job candidates the relative security roles and responsibilities of the position during the pre-employment process. Including any involvement in processing covered information documented in relevant job descriptions.[b]

Terms and conditions of employment 
The contractual agreements with employees and contractors shall state their and the organization’s responsibilities for information security.[c]

Human Resources must have a formal set of pre-employment forms and requirements that are distributed to all potential new personnel once a job offer is extended.

The identify of the applicant must be ascertained by passport, and/or government issued identification in accordance with the requirements of an I-9 form[d].

Because the pre-employment forms facilitate the collection of personal information, including credit information, information about education, certifications, prior employment, background check information and the testing for drug usage, notice of the collection of the above information (not an exhaustive list) must be given to the potential new personnel and the individual must provide a signed acknowledgement and authorization prior to the collection of the information.

Human Resources shall perform, or contract for the performance of a comprehensive background check to include the potential new employees’ assertions of previous employment, education, and credentials earned.[e]

In addition, the background check must include a credit check, criminal background check, drug, and reference checks and shall be proportional to the business requirements, the classification of the information to be accessed, and the perceived risks.[f]

All offers of employment will be contingent on the satisfactory results of a background investigation and drug screening.

Upon satisfactory completion of the background checks, 
Human Resources will notify the hiring manager of the start date.

The hiring manager will notify IT Support of the start date and the appropriate role for the individual that encompasses the appropriate access and privileges the potential new-employee will require to perform their job.

In addition, the hiring manager must secure any other items such as VPN access, credit cards, and mobile device(s) as required.

All new personnel must sign the terms and conditions of the employment contract, which shall include their responsibilities for information security and include confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements prior to commencing employment.[g]

All new personnel must complete new hire orientation, attend Security Awareness Education sessions and sign a document stating they understand the principles of the Security Awareness Education and are aware of any disciplinary actions that may arise if the employee were to violate the Information Security Policies of the organization.[h]

Annually Managers must evaluate the performance of individuals and teams against the entity’s expected standards of conduct.[i]

Competent personnel with sufficient authority perform control activities with diligence and continuing focus.[j]

Competence As part of the annual review Archway Health shall:
a) determine the necessary competence of person(s) doing work under its control that affects its information security performance;
b) ensure that these persons are competent on the basis of appropriate education, training, or experience;
c) where applicable, take actions to acquire the necessary competence, and evaluate the effectiveness
of the actions taken; and
d) retain appropriate documented information as evidence of competence.[k]

Uses Knowledgeable Personnel Evaluators performing ongoing and separate evaluations have sufficient knowledge to understand what is being evaluated.[l]

Segregation of duties Conflicting duties and areas of responsibility shall be segregated to reduce opportunities for unauthorized or unintentional modification or misuse of the organization’s assets.[m]

For any questions regarding the Security Program or Security Policies, please consult with the Chief Security Officer or her/his designate.

Separate Communication Lines Separate communication channels, such as whistle-blower hotlines, are in place and serve as fail-safe mechanisms to enable anonymous or confidential communication when normal channels are inoperative or ineffe[n]ctive.

1. Management Commitment

Archway Health is committed to protecting its employees, partners, clients, Archway Health, and the data Archway Health houses from illegal or damaging actions by individuals, either knowingly or unknowingly.  This policy is a tool management uses to demonstrate and carry out its commitment.[o]
