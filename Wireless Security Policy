Wireless Security Policy       
========================
Effective Date:  June 17, 2019

1.0         Purpose
-------------------
Wireless network accessibility to the Corporate Network introduces a
very convenient way to access network resources while on the company
premises.  

Certain security measures are in effect to securely offer this level of
access to employees and guests, but there is also a responsibility for
each user to comply with certain polices while using this communication
method.

Due to the inherent security risk in allowing this type of access, and
to protect non-public information that is stored on or transmitted by
wireless devices from unauthorized disclosure, modification, or theft,
required the Company to implement the appropriate security measures
outlined in this Policy for wireless networks.

2.0         Definitions
-----------------------

Definitions are located in the Information Security Program Definitions
document.  

If you do not find a definition for an unfamiliar term referenced within
this document, please contact the Chief Security Officer or her/his
designate for clarification.

3.0         Scope
-----------------

This policy prohibits access to internal corporate networks using
non-company issued, or unsecured wireless communication mechanisms and
devices.  Only wireless systems that meet the criteria of this policy or
those granted an exclusive written waiver by the Chief Security Officer,
or her/his designate can provide connectivity to the corporate networks.

This policy covers all wireless data communication devices (e.g.,
personal computers, wireless access cards, wireless access points,
mobile devices, PDAs, tablets, etc.) connected to any of the internal
networks.

All other Security Policies are still in effect while utilizing the
wireless network.  

This policy applies to employees, affiliates, subsidiaries,
Subcontractors, Service Providers, and any individual or entity that has
access to Information Resources.

Wireless devices and/or networks without any connectivity to the
corporate networks do not fall under the purview of this policy.

Compliance is mandatory.  Violation of this policy may result in (but is
not limited to) loss of access privileges, termination of employment,
criminal charges and/or other actions, as deemed appropriate by the
company.

Personnel who have questions regarding this Policy should consult with
the Chief Security Officer or her/his designate.

4.0         Risk Statement
--------------------------

If the wireless network does not conform to the requirements of this
policy, the wireless network may come under attack by those wishing to
cause a Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
attack, gain unauthorized access, or commit other attacks on the
network.  In addition, a malicious individual may attempt to breach the
network defenses and install copies of spyware, Trojans, viruses, worms,
rootkits, or ransomware.

Information Resources are a critical asset that the corporation strives
to protect based on the risk to the corporation and possible threats to
the Information Resource.

The basic threats are disclosure, modification, theft, or destruction
that can result in financial loss, gains to competitors, legal
liability, theft of information, loss of client/customer privacy, major
embarrassment, loss of productivity, loss of resources, and/or
reputation degradation.

5.0         Requirements
------------------------

*General Wireless Controls*

1.  Do not use wireless devices for the transmission or storage of
    Protected Information unless the data is properly encrypted using
    approved encryption methods.

2.  Do not transmit non-public information over wireless networks
    without encryption and prior approval of the Chief Security Officer
    or her/his designate.

3.  Do not copy, move, or store Protected Information onto local hard
    drives and/or removable electronic media when accessing such data
    via wireless access technologies

4.  All wireless devices must require users, including Guest users, to
    provide proper authentication prior to gaining
    access. [[1]](#cmnt-ref1)

*Approved Technology*

All wireless communication access must use company-approved vendor
products and security configurations.  For a list of current corporate
approved vendor products and security configurations please contact the
Chief Security Officer or her/his designate

*Register Access Points and Cards*

The Chief Security Officer or her/his designate must approve all
wireless Access Points / Base Stations connected to the corporate
network.

The Network Operations team must register all wireless Access Points /
Base Stations connected to the corporate network.[[2]](#cmnt-ref2)

These Access Points / Base Stations are subject to periodic penetration
tests and audits by the Chief Security Officer, or her/his
designate. [[3]](#cmnt-ref3)

In addition, a current network diagram shall be updated and available
for review. [[4]](#cmnt-ref4)

*Physical Security*

Proper physical controls minimize the risk that an unauthorized user may
gain access to the wireless device by exploiting weaknesses in physical
security.  

Locate wireless components in secure areas, limiting physical access to
authorized technical and administrative personnel using user
authentication, badges, special keys, enclosures, or other appropriate
security devices.

Obvious risks to physical security (other than theft) include the
ability of an unauthorized person to reset the Wireless Access Points
(WAP) to insecure, factory defaults.  The reset function poses a
particular problem because it allows an individual to negate any
security settings that administrators have configured in the WAP.

Additionally, a malicious person can invoke reset remotely over the
management interface or by using a administrative interface on the WAP. 
Adequate mechanisms need to be in place to prevent unauthorized
physical access to wireless devices.

-   Use WAPs with enclosures and mounting options that prevent physical
    access to ports and reset features.  For increased security, house
    WAPs in tamper-proof enclosures.

-   Use a wireless monitoring system that can track and locate all
    wireless devices and report if one or more devices are missing.

-   Mount WAPs on ceilings and walls that do not allow easy physical
    access.

*Wireless Architecture and Configuration*

The IT Department must:

1.  Standardize, deploy, and store specific builds for all wireless
    devices to ensure security controls are consistently implemented and
    enforceable.

2.  Conduct security reviews (every six months) on wireless
    communications to ensure appropriate settings are active and provide
    supporting documentation.

3.  Ensure software and devices that connect to the network are
    up-to-date with anti-virus software and at the latest security patch
    level for the associated operating system.

4.  Configure the highest possible level of security available on the
    wireless device to conform to this policy.

5.  Ensure the wireless configuration does not adversely affect
    neighboring installations.

*Change defaults on Wireless Access Points*

Changing default administrative passwords, encryption settings, reset
function, automatic network connection functions, and factory default
shared keys and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
access [[5]](#cmnt-ref5) will help eliminate many of the vulnerabilities
that can affect the security of the Information Resources through
unauthorized wireless access. [[6]](#cmnt-ref6)

-   Enable WPA2 and use Enterprise mode where possible.[[7]](#cmnt-ref7)

-   Change any default Pre-Shared Key (PSK).

-   Disable SNMP access to remote APs if possible.  If not, change
    default SNMP passwords and use SNMPv3 with authentication and
    privacy enabled.

-   Do not advertise organization names in the Service Set Identifier
    (SSID) broadcast.

-   Suppress the SSID though this is not necessarily a security
    mechanism (more of a deterrent) as a hacker can sniff the SSID using
    trivial techniques.

-   Synchronize the APs’ clocks via the Network Time Protocol (NTP) to
    other networking equipment used by the organization.

-   Disable all unnecessary applications, ports, and protocols.

-   Change encryption keys anytime anyone with knowledge of the keys
    leaves the company or changes position. [[8]](#cmnt-ref8)

-   Apply configuration standards that are in line with this and other
    Security Policies. [[9]](#cmnt-ref9)

*Internal Network Address Access and Restriction*

Configure the wireless system to:

-   Segregate wireless networks from internal and private networks but
    installing a firewall between any wireless network and Protected
    Information networks. [[10]](#cmnt-ref10)

-   Prohibit restricted internal Domain Name System (DNS) information
    from becoming available via the Internet.

-   Conceal Information Resources from external sources.

-   Ensure that no inside addresses designated as non-routable pass to
    the outside.

-   Be flexible enough to implement corporate security policies
    effectively and efficiently.

*Wireless Authentication and Encryption*

1.  Implement (Wi-Fi Protected Access II) WPA2-Enterprise authentication
    with PSK.[[11]](#cmnt-ref11)

2.  Utilize Advanced Encr yption Standard (AES) encryption for wireless
    network connections to provide authorized wireless access to the
    Information Resources. [[12]](#cmnt-ref12)

3.  Do not use Wireless Equivalent Privacy (WEP) keys within the
    environment, as this protocol is not secure.

4.  When possible, 256-bit encryption is preferred.

*Wireless LAN*

1.  Client devices with Wireless LAN support should not operate in
    “Ad-Hoc Mode” or otherwise provide wireless connectivity to other
    devices.

2.  Do not use wireless client devices to communicate directly with each
    other through a peer-to-peer connection. [[13]](#cmnt-ref13)

3.  Do not use VLAN based segmentation with MAC address filters for
    segmenting wireless networks.

When designing, deploying, and managing communications between external
(hostile) networks and wireless networks, include the implementation of
a firewall technology solution to isolate this traffic from the internal
network to facilitate the protection of the Information Resources from
unauthorized access, modifications, or destruction. [[14]](#cmnt-ref14)

*VPN and Multi-Factor Authentication*

All devices enabled with wireless access must utilize the
corporate-approved VPN to access any environment that has Protected
Information. [[15]](#cmnt-ref15)

Management must approve access for the wireless network to gain access
to the production environment after receiving the appropriate forms
containing a valid business justification.  

*Auditing, Monitoring, and Alert Management*

Monitor real-time wireless device alerts (if available) for suspicious
behavior including changes in the known state of the network. 
Appropriate review and escalation procedures should also be
utilized. [[16]](#cmnt-ref16)  

Wireless devices must log all activity to a permanent monitored system
log.  Enable historical logging of wireless access that can provide
granular wireless device information and store event logs and statistics
for at least twenty-four (24) months.

Use a centrally controlled wireless IDS/IPS to monitor for unauthorized
access and detect rogues and misconfigured wireless devices.  Update the
IDS/IPS signature set on a daily basis or after the discovery of a new
threat.

Generate a monthly report showing periodic wireless scans showing any
rogue wireless devices.  If rogue devices are present, remove them from
the network and rerun the scan. [[17]](#cmnt-ref17)

Monitor and resolve all security violations, and notify the Chief
Security Officer, or her/his designate, of any unresolved or recurring
events.

6.0         Management Commitment
---------------------------------

The Company is committed to protecting its employees, partners, clients,
the company, and the data the company houses from illegal or damaging

7.0         Coordination among Organizational Entities
------------------------------------------------------

The company wants all organizational entities to cooperate and
coordinate with each other to ensure the effectiveness of the
Information Security Program. [[19]](#cmnt-ref19)

8.0             Compliance
--------------------------

Compliance is mandatory.  Violation of this policy may result in (but is
not limited to) loss of access privileges, termination of employment,
